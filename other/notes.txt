- set up zotero drive
	- probably create google drive folder with all pdfs? -> link zotero to that drive?

- HLA homozygozity -> cancer + illness

	- look at HLA associations for HIV/EBV/Hepatitis/herpes simplex (A02:01 protective against EBV?)
	- loook at all cancers for HLA / age distributions
		- KS test on all age distributions and cluster (spectral?)


	- viral associated cancers:
		- look for viral infection -> any cancers (viral encephalitis -> gbm?	)
		- burkitt lymphoma
		- hodgkin lymphoma
		- stomach cancer
		- nasopharyngeal cancer
		- gastric cancer
		- liver

	- Compare HLA Diversity among people and see if there is clustering in terms of expressive ability:
		- cluster based based on graph -> make heatmap
			- show that certain groups who cluster have higher rates of T-cell mediated autoimmunity?
		- show separate from ethnicity

	- separate by zygosity, age, and sex for hodgins +
	- control with cervical
	- miniumum of grantham distance of A,B,C (separate )

	- How to account

	- autoimmunity
		- remove known associated alleles?
			- find way to see if it is reduced t cell repetoire or just dosing effects from known alleles


	- EBV protective alleles (or hepatitis, HIV etc):
		- look to see if these have stronger effect on EBV associated cancers
			- subset with people who have these alleles: look at ages, sex, grantham dist,

	- antecedent infections:
		- look for infections that precede illness diagnoses



UK biobank questions:
	- how to interpret the HLA codes?
	- difference between ICD10 cancer type (83k) and cancer code (41K entries)
