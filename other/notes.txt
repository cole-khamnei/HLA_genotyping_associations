- set up zotero drive
	- probably create google drive folder with all pdfs? -> link zotero to that drive?

- HLA homozygozity -> cancer + illness
	- calculate grantham distance for all bb, lookup hospital codes for cancers + ebv associated cancers -> calculate OR

	- look at HLA associations for HIV/EBV/Hepatitis/herpes simplex (A02:01 protective against EBV?)
	- loook at all cancers for HLA / age distributions
		- KS test on all age distributions and cluster (spectral?)


	- viral associated cancers:
		- look for viral infection -> any cancers (viral encephalitis -> gbm?	)
		- burkitt lymphoma
		- hodgkin lymphoma
		- stomach cancer
		- nasopharyngeal cancer
		- gastric cancer
		- liver

	- Compare HLA Diversity among people and see if there is clustering in terms of expressive ability:
		- cluster based based on graph -> make heatmap
			- show that certain groups who cluster have higher rates of T-cell mediated autoimmunity?
		- show separate from ethnicity



UK biobank questions:
	- how to interpret the HLA codes?
	- difference between ICD10 cancer type (83k) and cancer code (41K entries)
